## Lecture 03 - Templates and Ostream

#### Jan 21st 

- In this lecture we converted an integer stack to a templated stack.
- As we were doing this we needed a new data type, so we created a point3D type.
- We overloaded ostream to print out point3D's and pointers to point3D's as well.
- On a tangent, we shot over to double pointer territory and discussed dynamic 2D arrays.
- We discussed passing pointers around to methods instead of data types and saw how certain structures could grow pretty big, but a pointer to that structure was a consistent small 4 or 8 bytes.
