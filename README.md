>**1**. Lowest exam grade can be replaced by Final Exam grade if deemed appropriate by instructor. This is for students who attend class and participate.
>
>**2**. To earn an "A" in the course, every program must be: **1)** turned in **2)** must compile / run and **3)** must at least minimally fulfill the requirements of the assignment. This does not mean each program must receive an "A" as a grade. It simply means that "A" level work in a programming course means all programs should be completed and working. It is possible to get "C"'s and even "D"'s on multiple programs and still earn an "A" in the course, although not probable :) 
>
>**3**. The dynamic nature of the way I teach courses could result in a seperate category for Assignments. No two classes are the same and some classes need many smaller "homework" type assignments as opposed to a series of larger "programs". HOWEVER! Nothing will be changed without input and agreement from the students in the class. The only time I will make changes to the grading policy is when **1)** I feel it is in the best interest of the class and **2)** the class agrees by majority vote. 
>
>**4**. Plane ticket prices, events like weddings, or trips out of the country are not valid excuses for missing the final exam time. I will not make accommodations for anything other than an issue vetted by the dean of students. 


## Miscellaneous

- All students need a [Github](http://github.com) account
- All programs need to be turned in to pass the course
- General Assignment Rules:
    - Due dates and times are as listed on assignment and can change with prior notice to class.
    - Formatting of programs is important, and will be graded accordingly. 
    - You name is required on ALL documents uploaded or turned in. Handwritten name is not acceptable.
    - All files / programs created by you will end up in your assignments folder within your Github repository. 
- Attending class is one of the primary keys to doing well in this class. Students may be dropped for excessive absences. There is no distinction made between excused and unexcused.
- Make-up exams are not given. If I see fit, then I will replace a missed exam with your final exam test grade (but this is optional to instructor based on circumstances, attendance, participation, etc.).
- Programs containing syntax errors are unacceptable and will be returned without grading (your programs must work).
- Periodically homework assignments will be taken up and graded. It is the student's responsibility to keep up with assignments and to ask questions over the assigned work, even if absent. All homework assignments are due at the specified time that may or may not be in conjunction with a class day. All assignments / homeworks will be uploaded via Github.
