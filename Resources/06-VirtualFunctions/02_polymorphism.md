## Polymorphism in C++

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.   Real life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.   

Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.  

### In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

  - Compile time Polymorphism
  - Runtime Polymorphism

### 1) Compile time polymorphism: 
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

- **Function Overloading**: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be **overloaded** . Functions can be overloaded by **change in number of arguments** or/and **change in type of arguments** .  

**Example** :
```cpp
// C++ program for function overloading
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
class Geeks {

public:
    // function with 1 int parameter

    void func(int x) {
        cout << "value of x is " << x << endl;
    }

    // function with same name but 1 double parameter

    void func(double x) {

        cout << "value of x is " << x << endl;
    }

    // function with same name and 2 int parameters

    void func(int x, int y)
            cout
        << "value of x and y is " << x << ", " << y << endl;
    }
};

int main() {

    Geeks obj1;

    // Which function is called will depend on the parameters passed
    // The first 'func' is called

    obj1.func(7);

    // The second 'func' is called

    obj1.func(9.132);

    // The third 'func' is called

    obj1.func(85, 64);

    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
    value of x is 7
    value of x is 9.132
    value of x and y is 85, 64
```

In the above example, a single function named *func* acts differently in three different situations which is the property of polymorphism.

- **Operator Overloading**: C++ also provide option to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’) for string class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add two operands. So a single operator ‘+’ when placed between integer operands , adds them and when placed between string operands, concatenates them.  

**Example** :

```cpp
// CPP program to illustrate
// Operator Overloading
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
    int real;
    int imag;

public:
    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0) {
        real = r;
        imag = i;
    }

    // This is automatically called when '+' is used with
    // between two Complex objects

    Complex operator+(Complex const &obj) {
        Complex res;
        res.real = real + obj.real;
        res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
        return res;
    }

    void print() {
        cout << real << " + i" << imag << endl;
    }
};

int main() {

    Complex c1(10, 5), c2(2, 4);

    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;
    // An example call to "operator+"
    c3.print();
}

```
**Output:**
```
    12 + i9
```

In the above example the operator ‘+’ is overloaded. The operator ‘+’ is an addition operator and can add two numbers(integers or floating point) but here the operator is made to perform addition of two imaginary or complex numbers.

### 1) Runtime polymorphism]

This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.

- **Function overriding**: on the other hand occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be **overridden** .



```cpp
// C++ program for function overriding

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
    virtual void print() {
        cout << "print base class" << endl;
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "show base class" << endl;
    }
};

class derived : public base {
public:
    void print()
    //print () is already virtual function in derived class, we could also declared as virtual void print () explicitly
    {
        cout << "print derived class" << endl;
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "show derived class" << endl;
    }
};

//main function
int main() {

    base *bptr;
    derived d;
    bptr = &d;

    //virtual function, binded at runtime (Runtime polymorphism)

    bptr->print();

    // Non-virtual function, binded at compile time
    bptr->show();

    return 0;
}

```

**Output:**
```
    print derived class
    show base class
```
