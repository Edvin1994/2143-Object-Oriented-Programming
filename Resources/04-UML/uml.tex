\subsection{UML - Unified Modeling
Language}\label{uml---unified-modeling-language}}

\hypertarget{what-are-uml-diagrams}{%
\subsubsection{What are UML Diagrams?}\label{what-are-uml-diagrams}}

UML Diagrams stands for Unified Modeling Language. It is a standard
which is mainly used for creating object-oriented, meaningful
documentation models for any software system present in the real world.
It provides us a way to develop rich models that describe the working of
any software/hardware systems.

UML serves a great way of creating professional documentation which is a
necessary part of any project development. UML is an essential part of
creating an object-oriented design of systems. It provides you means for
creating powerful models and designs for rational systems which can be
understood without much difficulties.

\hypertarget{characteristics-of-uml}{%
\subsubsection{Characteristics of UML}\label{characteristics-of-uml}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  It is a generalized modeling language.
\item
  It is different from software programming languages such as Python, C,
  C++, etc.
\item
  It is a pictorial language which can be used to generate powerful
  modeling elements.
\item
  It is related to object-oriented designs and analysis.
\item
  It has unlimited applications even outside the software industry. It
  can be used to visualize the workflow of a factory.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{building-blocks}{%
\subsubsection{Building Blocks}\label{building-blocks}}

UML is an abstract view of how (in our case) objects relate together. It
is a \textbf{conceptual model} that helps us understand:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What the objects are
\item
  How object interact
\end{itemize}

You have to understand the entities and relationships between them
before you can actually modeling a system using the components given to
us by UML. However, you are familiar with most of them because they fit
with the OOP way of looking at things:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Object}: It is a real-world entity. There are multiple objects
  available within a single system. It is a fundamental building block
  of UML.
\item
  \textbf{Class}: A class is nothing but a container where objects and
  their relationships are maintained.
\item
  \textbf{Abstraction}: It is a mechanism of representing an entity
  without showing the implementation details. It is used to visualize
  the behavior of an object.
\item
  \textbf{Inheritance}: It is a mechanism of extending an existing class
  to create a new class.
\item
  \textbf{Polymorphism}: It is a mechanism of representing an object
  having multiple forms which are used for different purposes.
\item
  \textbf{Encapsulation}: It is a method of binding the object and the
  data together as a single unit. It ensures tight coupling between the
  object and the data.
\end{itemize}

We can use these building blocks to generate UML diagrams that model our
projects and let us design before actually coding them.

\hypertarget{what-is-uml-diagram}{%
\subsubsection{What is UML Diagram?}\label{what-is-uml-diagram}}

UML Diagrams are the output of the Unified Modeling Language. It is a
pictorial representation of classes, objects, and relationships between
them. It is used to give a visual depiction of the functionality or a
design of a system. A diagram must be clear and concise so that the
viewer will readily understand it.

UML diagrams are divided into three different categories such as,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Structural diagram
\item
  Behavioral diagram
\item
  Interaction diagram
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structural-diagrams}{%
\paragraph{Structural diagrams}\label{structural-diagrams}}

Structural diagrams are used to represent a static view of a system. It
represents a part of a system that makes up the structure of a system. A
structural diagram shows various objects within the system.

Following are the various structural diagrams in UML:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Class diagram
\item
  Object diagram
\item
  Package diagram
\item
  Component diagram
\item
  Deployment diagram
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{behavioral-diagrams}{%
\paragraph{Behavioral diagrams}\label{behavioral-diagrams}}

Any real-world system can be represented in either a static form or a
dynamic form. A system is said to be complete if it is expressed in both
the static and dynamic ways. The behavioral diagram represents the
functioning of a system.

UML diagrams that deals with the static part of a system are called
structural diagrams. UML diagrams that deals with the moving or dynamic
parts of the system are called behavioral diagrams.

Following are the various behavioral diagrams in UML:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Activity diagram
\item
  Use case diagram
\item
  State machine diagram
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{interaction-diagrams}{%
\paragraph{Interaction diagrams}\label{interaction-diagrams}}

Interaction diagram is nothing but a subset of behavioral diagrams. It
is used to visualize the flow between various use case elements of a
system. Interaction diagrams are used to show an interaction between two
entities and how data flows within them.

Following are the various interaction diagrams in UML:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Timing diagram
\item
  Sequence diagram
\item
  Collaboration diagram
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{uml-building-blocks}{%
\subsubsection{UML Building Blocks}\label{uml-building-blocks}}

These are building blocks at a higher level than the previously
mentioned ones. These building blocks are the things required to develop
one full UML model diagram. Following are the basic UML building blocks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Things
\item
  Relationships
\item
  Diagrams
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{things}{%
\subsection{Things}\label{things}}

A thing can be described as any real-world entity or an object. Things
are divided into various categories in UML as follows,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Structural things
\item
  Behavioral things
\item
  Grouping things
\item
  Annotational things
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structural-things}{%
\subsubsection{Structural things}\label{structural-things}}

A structural thing is used to describe the static part of a model. It is
used to represent the things that are visible to human eyes. Structural
things are all about the physical part of a system. It is the noun of a
UML model, such as a class, object, interface, collaboration, use case,
component, and a node.

Structural things consist of:

\hypertarget{class}{%
\paragraph{Class:}\label{class}}

A class is used to represent various objects. It is used to define the
properties and operations of an object. In UML, we can also represent an
abstract class. A class whose functionalities are not defined is called
an abstract class. Any UML class notation is generally expressed as
follows,

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}c@{}}

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{object}{%
\paragraph{Object:}\label{object}}

An object is an entity which is used to describe the behavior and
functions of a system. The class and object have the same notations. The
only difference is that an object name is always underlined in UML.

The notation of any object in UML is given below.

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{interface}{%
\paragraph{Interface:}\label{interface}}

An interface is similar to a template without implementation details. A
circle notation represents it. When a class implements an interface, its
functionality is also implemented.

state machines. Behavioral things are used to represent the behavior of
a system.

Behavioral things consist of:

\hypertarget{state-machine}{%
\paragraph{State machine:}\label{state-machine}}

It used to describe various states of a single component throughout the
software development life cycle. It is used to capture different states
of a system component.

An activity diagram is used to represent various activities carried out
by different components of a system. It is denoted the same as that of
the state machine diagram.

Activity diagram mainly contains initial state, final state, a decision
box, and an action notation.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}c@{}}

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{grouping-things}{%
\subsubsection{Grouping things}\label{grouping-things}}

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{relationships}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships}\label{relationships}}

The relationship allows you to show on a model how two or more things
relate to each other. The relationship in UML will enable you to capture
meaningful connections between things. It shows how each element is
associated with each other and how this association describes the
functionality of an application.

Relationships in UML are categorized as follows,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Association relationship
\item
  Dependency relationship
\item
  Generalization relationship
\item
  Realization relationship
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{association-relationship}{%
\paragraph{Association relationship}\label{association-relationship}}

It is a set of links that connect elements of the UML model. It also
defines how many objects are taking part in that relation. It
illustrates how many elements are participating in a particular
interaction.

It is denoted as a dotted line with arrowheads on both sides. Both the
sides contain an element which describes the relationship. A new term
multiplicity is introduced that tells us how many objects of a
particular element are associated.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}c@{}}
\toprule

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{dependency-relationship}{%
\paragraph{Dependency relationship}\label{dependency-relationship}}

In this kind of a relationship, the source element is dependent upon the
target element and may be affected by changes to it. It is one of the
most important notations of UML. It defines the direction of a
dependency from one object to another.

It is denoted by a dotted line with an arrow at one side.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}c@{}}
\toprule

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{generalization-relationship}{%
\paragraph{Generalization
relationship}\label{generalization-relationship}}

It is also called as a parent-child relationship. It is a relationship
between a general thing and a more specific kind of a thing. This type
of relationship is used to represent the inheritance concept.

It is denoted by a straight line with a hollow arrowhead at one side.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}c@{}}
\toprule

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{realization-relationship}{%
\paragraph{Realization relationship}\label{realization-relationship}}

In this, one element describes some responsibility which is not
implemented and the other elements implement the functionality mentioned
by the first element. Realization relationship is widely used while
denoting interfaces.

It is denoted as a dotted line with a hollow arrowhead at one end.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}c@{}}

Summary A model is said to be an abstraction of a system that hides the
implementation details. It provides blueprint and structure of a system.
It helps us to define the structural and behavioral aspects of a system.
Things, relationships and diagrams are three building blocks of UML.
Thing is nothing but any real-world entity. Relationships are used to
describe the connection between one or more things. Various UML diagrams
are used to describe different aspects of a single system.
