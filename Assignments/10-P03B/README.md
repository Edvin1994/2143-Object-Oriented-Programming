## Program 3B - BolNiverse Fight Club
#### Due: 10-20-2021 (Wednesday @ 12:00 p.m.)


### Overview

This assignment is about designing your **BolNiverse Fight Club** program. Yes we got sidetracked into Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, and AsciiCat in Python, but we can't give up. I want you to design your Bolniverse Fight Club using the **U**nified **M**odeling **L**anguage. Below are a couple of resources for you to use. The first link is a youtube video that is pushing [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) but it really is the best 10 minute overview of UML. The other link is more of a resource or reference.
