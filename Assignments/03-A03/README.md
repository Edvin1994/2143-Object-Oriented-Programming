#### Fill Out Form:

- Here is a link to the form for assignment 1: <a href="https://forms.gle/K2JkXKYUJ2s3GkJ96"><img src="https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/product/2x/forms_2020q4_48dp.png" width="30">Form For Contact Info</a>

- Fill out the form fields accurately please. I use this info to automate some grading tasks and if your info is wrong, you could break my scripts and might not get grades for some items.
- I made it so you can re-submit the form many times. I'll just pick your latest version.
