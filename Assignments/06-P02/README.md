## Program 2 - MyVector Class 2
#### Due: 09-22-2021 (Wednesday @ 12:00 p.m.)

## Overview

Using code from [Program 1](../05-P01/singly_linked.cpp) create a more robust `MyVector` class that includes some added functionality with the overloading of some C++ operators. The operations performed by using a particular operator will be defined by us with a brief discussion on what we should do. We do not have to abide by convention, we can define each operator to do anything we want.


## Requirements
- Overload `[]` so that your `MyVector` can be treated as an array. 
- Overload `<<` (ostream) so that printing to std out is easy. 
- Overload `<<` (ofstream) so that printing to outfile is easy. 
- Overload `+` (addition)  
- Overload `-` (substraction)  
- Overload `*` (multiplication)  
- Overload `/` (division)  
- Overload `==` (equality) 
- Overload `=` (assignment) 
- Overlad `push_back` to accept an array of values which will be appended to the existing vector.


## Testing your code

Given:

```cpp

Vector<int> v1;
Vector<int> v2;

// USAGE TO COME AFTER DISCUSSION
```

### Deliverables

- Create a folder in your assignments folder called `P02`
- In that folder create a file called README.md
- Help with markdown: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
- Look at [this](../../Resources/02-Readmees/README.md) to help with your `README.md` file
- Create a banner for your program **(see [HERE](../../Resources/03-Banner/README.md))**.
  - Make sure your banner is readable and does NOT have blank lines betweenon every other row.

```
2143 
P02
Name
```

- Print out your source code. Make sure it's **[commented](../../Resources/01-Comments/README.md)**.
- Print out your output file.
- Put your assignment on the lecture podium at the beginning of class.
- Staple everything in this order:
  - **1)** Banner (on top)
  - **2)** Source code (middle)
  - **3)** Output (bottom)
- Any hand writing on your assignment is reduction in 1 letter grade.
- Failure to follow instructions is a reduction in 1 letter grade.
- Unreadable banner is a reduction in 1 letter grade.
