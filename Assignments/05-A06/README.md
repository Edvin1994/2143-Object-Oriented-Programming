Choose one of the following. I would go for the full install first. But if you just can't get
it running, try the single directory.

### What Am I Doing??

- Goal is to get the green ball to print in its own window.

- Thats it. If you get it to run, you're in business.

### What to turn in:

- Create a folder in your assignments folder called `A06`
- In that folder create a file called README.md
- Put links to your 2 files in the README.md and a description:

```
## SFML Intro 

This is the "hello world" of SFML game programming. 


### Files
- [test.cpp](test.cpp) 
- [screenshot.png](screenshot.png)
```
- Make a banner:

```
2143
A06
YOURNAME
```


- Print out:
  - The Banner
  - `test.cpp`
  - screenshot
- And bring to class on Tuesday the 2<sup>nd</sup> of February.
- Remember it still needs to be on Github by the previous Friday at Noon.
