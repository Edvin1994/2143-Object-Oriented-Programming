## Program 3 - Blackjack
#### Due: 10-21-2022 (Friday @ 11:00 a.m.)


### Overview

Using the description from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y0g9z5k5ww3ftx7/1.1Design%20Blackjack%20and%20a%20Deck%20of%20Cards%20-%20Grokking%20the%20Object%20Oriented%20Design%20Interview.html?dl=0) design and implement a console based blackjack game that can be played by 1 player against a dealer. 

The rules for blackjack are pretty straightforward so this shouldnt be to difficult. I won't require you to implement **splitting** or **insurance**, but feel free to add those in if you like.
