## Test 2 - Basic Concepts
#### Due: 10-21-2022 (Friday @ 11:00 a.m.)

## Study Guide

### Some Class Operators

- Operators: 
  - What is the dot `.` operator for?
  - What does the tilde `~` imply? (And not bitwise operations).
  - What does the `->` arrow operator imply?
  
### Slightly Random Statements
- Write a single C++ statement that dynamically allocates a single int and initializes it to 99.
- Write one or more C++ statements that dynamically allocates an array of 99 `ints` and initializes each one to zero

### Inheritance
- https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/inheritance
- Base Class vs Derived Class
- Parent Class vs Child Class
- Multilevel vs Hierarchical vs Multiple Inheritance
- Relationships: 
  - Is-A, Has-A, Kind-Of, 
  - Inherit vs Composition 

### Friend Function
- When is the friend keyword used? 
- Can you think of an example of when not to use it?
- Some claim that using the Friend keyword breaks encapsulation. What do you find to be the answer?

### Polymorphism
 - Compile Time Polymorphism or Static Polymorphism 
 - (aka early binding or Static binding)
  - Function overloading
  - Operator overloading 
- Runtime Polymorphism or  Dynamic Polymorphism 
  - (aka late binding or dynamic binding)
  - Function overriding
  - Virtual Functions 
- Questions:
  - What is a virtual function? Is it necessary?
  - What is a pure virtual function?
  - The destructor of base class should always be virtual. Why is that?

### Abstract Classes
(Overlap with virtual and pure virtual above)
- What is an abstract class?
- How can we make a class abstract?
- How many objects can be created from an abstract class?
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_interfaces.htm
- https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/abcs

- Default protection of a class is?
- Default protection of a struct is?

- What can access private data members or member functions of a class?

- What type type of data member can be shared by all instances of its class?

- Be able to compare and contrast:
  - class definition vs class implementation
  - class vs object (aka instance)


- Constructors and Destructors
  - Example: 
    - Which can take parameters and which cannot?
    - When are each of them run?


- List three reasons why it is useful to be able to inherit characteristics from parent classes
