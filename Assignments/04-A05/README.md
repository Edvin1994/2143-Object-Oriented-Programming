## Homework 2 - Basic OOP terminology
#### Due: 01-28-2021 (Tuesday @ 9:30 a.m.)

This assignment should have been assigned first week, I just dropped the ball. I want you to look up the following definitions and provide a definition using your own words, as you understand the concept. Cutting and pasting from online sources is NOT what this is about. I won't grade your assignment based on long ... copied definitions, I will be looking for words that are not regurgitated from other sources. Also, one line definitions with total lack of effort will get you a poor grade as well.

The goal is to break the ice with these concepts so when they come up in class, I clarify and add to your knowledge base. I'm not totally introducing each concept. Trust me, this list scratches the surface! It's not like I'm asking you to learn OOP so I can turn around and teach you .... OOP :) I'm asking you to prime your grey matter for better uptake later.


### Key Words

- Abstraction
- Attributes / Properties
- Class
- Class Variable
- Composition
- Constructor
- Encapsulation
- Friends
- Inheritance
- Instance Variable
- Member Variable
- Method
- Multiple Inheritance
- Object
- Overloading
- Polymorphism
- Public / Private / Protected
- Static
- Virtual

### What to turn in:

- Create a folder in your assignments folder called `A05`
- In that folder create a file called README.md
- Place your definitions in this file.
- Help with markdown: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
- Do not print them out and bring them to class. Just put them in your repository.


## Example:

The following Markdown:

```
## A05

- Name: Francis Popperpot
- Date: 28 Jan 2021
- Class: 2143 OOP

## Definitions

#### Class

> This is your definition of what a class is. Using images is A-ok. For example:

#### Object
> This is your object definition....

#### Method
> This is your method definition.....

#### ETC...
```
Creates the following output:
