### What to turn in:

- To get a maximum score of 85, you can do the following:
  - Create a folder in your assignments folder called `OOP_Primer`
  - In that folder create a file called README.md
  - Place your definitions in this file.
  - Help with markdown: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
  - Do not print them out and bring them to class. Just put them in your repository.
