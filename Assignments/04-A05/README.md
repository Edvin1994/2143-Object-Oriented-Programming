#### Due: 12-03-2021 (Friday @ 12:00 p.m.)

I want you to start your own OOP primer that provides definitions and examples of all of the OOP concepts you see below (plus a few more I'm sure).


### Minimum List of Key Words and Concepts

- Abstraction
- Attributes / Properties
- Class
- Class Variable

- Constructor
- Encapsulation
- Friends
- Inheritance
- Instance Variable
- Member Variable
- Method
- Multiple Inheritance
- Object
- Overloading
- Polymorphism
- Public / Private / Protected
- Static
- Virtual

### What to turn in:

- To get a maximum score of 80, you can do the following:
  - Create a folder in your assignments folder called `OOP_Primer`
  - In that folder create a file called `README.md`
  - Each definition will be a section in your document and should include images and especially code examples when appropriate.
  - Place your definitions in a file similar to [THIS](example.md)
  - Help can be found in the resources below.


- To get a shot at full credit (100), you do the following:
  - Create a wiki for your `OOP primer`.
  - Each definition will be a page in your wiki to include images and especially code examples when appropriate.
  - Wikis are automatically a part of every repo and use the same markdown to create pages in them.
  - They simply add the ability to add additional organizing features (headers, footers, sidebar menus,etc.) 
  - You can even turn your a repo or wiki into a website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (not necessary for assignment).
