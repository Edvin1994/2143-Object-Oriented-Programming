### What to turn in:

- Create a folder in your assignments folder called `H02`
- In that folder create a file called README.md
- Place your definitions in this file.
- Help with markdown: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
- Do not print them out and bring them to class. Just put them in your repository.


## Example:

The following Markdown:

```
## H02

- Name: Francis Popperpot
- Date: 22 Sep 2020
- Class: 2143 OOP

## Definitions

#### Class
