In Dungeons and Dragons there are a few basic stats like: "Strength","Dexterity","Constitution","Intelligence","Wisdom","Charisma" that determine many of the outcomes when battling monsters or other players. I am going to implement a basic character class in python and assigning values for these attributes is easy enough. But for a complete character definition there needs to be additional attributes and methods to represent a handicap, like temporary blindness. Or a potion that was drunk to increase speed and power temporarily. What additional attributes would need to be added to robustly account for temporary increases or decreases in abilities. And possibly could you determine a formula that could be used to determine the temporary boost or debilitation to a character?
