When making an attack in D&D, there are usually two types of rolls: the attack roll and the damage roll. The attack roll determines whether the attack hits the target, while the damage roll determines how much damage the attack does if it hits.

The attack roll is made using a d20 die and adding the attacker's attack bonus. The attack bonus is calculated as follows:

attack bonus = proficiency bonus + ability modifier

The proficiency bonus is a value that depends on the character's level and increases as they gain more experience. The ability modifier is calculated based on the character's relevant ability score (e.g. Strength for a melee attack).

To incorporate base stats into the attack, we would need to modify the ability modifier based on the character's base stat values. For example, if a character has a high Strength score, they would have a higher ability modifier for melee attacks.

Here's a possible function that could calculate the attack bonus for a character based on their base stats:

```python

def calculate_attack_bonus(character_class, base_stats):
    proficiency_bonus = calculate_proficiency_bonus(character_level)
    ability_modifier = calculate_ability_modifier(character_class, base_stats)
    return proficiency_bonus + ability_modifier

def calculate_proficiency_bonus(character_level):
    if character_level < 5:
        return 2
    elif character_level < 9:
        return 3
    elif character_level < 13:
        return 4
    elif character_level < 17:
        return 5
    else:
        return 6

def calculate_ability_modifier(character_class, base_stats):
    if character_class in ["Barbarian", "Fighter", "Paladin"]:
        ability_score = base_stats["Strength"]
    elif character_class in ["Bard", "Rogue", "Warlock"]:
        ability_score = base_stats["Charisma"]
    elif character_class in ["Cleric", "Druid", "Ranger"]:
        ability_score = base_stats["Wisdom"]
    elif character_class in ["Monk"]:
        ability_score = max(base_stats["Strength"], base_stats["Dexterity"])
    elif character_class in ["Sorcerer", "Wizard"]:
        ability_score = base_stats["Intelligence"]
    else:
        ability_score = 0
    
    # Calculate ability modifier using standard D&D formula
    return (ability_score - 10) // 2
```

- Once we have the attack bonus, we can use it to make the attack roll by rolling a `d20` and adding the `attack bonus`. 
- The resulting value is compared to the target's armor class (AC) to see if the attack hits. 
- If the attack hits, we then roll the appropriate damage dice for the attack and add any bonuses based on the character's base stats (e.g. Strength for melee attacks) to get the final damage value.
