# D&D Game - Don't Get Excited ... This is Hard!

## Basic Characters

For each basic character, you should represent the following attributes:

| Attribute    | Description                                               | Min | Max |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-: | :-: |
| Strength     | measure of physical power and melee combat effectiveness. |  3  | 18  |
| Dexterity    | measure of agility and ranged combat effectiveness.       |  3  | 18  |
| Constitution | measure of health and resilience.                         |  3  | 18  |
| Intelligence | measure of knowledge and spell-casting ability.           |  3  | 18  |
| Wisdom       | measure of intuition and perception.                      |  3  | 18  |
| Charisma     | measure of personality and leadership.                    |  3  | 18  |

A basic character should also have 1 or more attributes that can be either be turned on or off, or set to some value which will either increase basic powers like a boost, or reduce powers like if they were blinded. Not sure what to call them. So we can discuss in class.

### Generating Characters

The standard method for generating attribute values for a new character is to roll `four six-sided dice` (`4d6`) and sum the three highest rolls, discarding the lowest roll. This is done six times, once for each attribute (`Strength`, `Dexterity`, `Constitution`, `Intelligence`, `Wisdom`, and `Charisma`), resulting in a set of six values that are used to determine the character's abilities.

The average value for a single `4d6` roll is `12.244`, and the average value for the sum of the three highest rolls is `12.244 * 3 = 36.732`. This means that the average starting value for a randomly generated attribute using the standard method is around `10-11` (which is the sum of the three highest rolls divided by 3).

However, it's important to note that these are just averages and the actual values can vary widely based on luck and chance. It's also common for Dungeon Masters to allow for alternative methods of generating attribute values, such as point-buy systems or fixed values, to provide more control and balance over character creation.

### Character Classes

Here are the characters that we will generate. They will extend a basic character class and are pretty basic:

## Attacking Monsters

In Dungeons and Dragons, characters damage monsters by rolling dice to determine the amount of damage dealt by their attacks. The specific die used depends on the character's weapon or attack, as well as any bonuses or modifiers that apply.

There should probably be an attack class which represents a specific attack, and its associated damages.

```cpp
class Attack{
protected:
    string category;
public:
};
```

## Walkthrough Character Generation

### Generic Steps

Each of these steps are applied to every character:

1. Roll 4 six-sided dice for each of the six attributes
   - Strength
   - Dexterity
   - Constitution
   - Intelligence
   - Wisdom
   - Charisma
2. Discard the lowest roll for each attribute.
3. Add up the remaining three dice rolls to get the attribute score.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all six attributes have been generated.



## Random Character Generation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

// Function to generate a random number between min and max
int random(int min, int max) {
    return rand() % (max - min + 1) + min;
}

int main() {
    // Seed the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Array of character names
    string characters[] = {"Warrior", "Wizard", "Rogue", "Cleric", "Paladin", "Druid", "Dwarf", "Elf"};

    // Loop through each character
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        string character = characters[i];

        // Generate random stats for the character
        int strength = random(8, 18);
        int dexterity = random(8, 18);
        int constitution = random(8, 18);
        int intelligence = random(8, 18);
        int wisdom = random(8, 18);
        int charisma = random(8, 18);

        // Output the stats for the character
        cout << character << ":" << endl;
        cout << "Strength: " << strength << endl;
        cout << "Dexterity: " << dexterity << endl;
        cout << "Constitution: " << constitution << endl;
        cout << "Intelligence: " << intelligence << endl;
        cout << "Wisdom: " << wisdom << endl;
        cout << "Charisma: " << charisma << endl;
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Random Die Rolling

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

class Die {
public:
    Die(int num_sides) {
        sides = num_sides;
        srand(time(NULL));
    }

    int roll() {
        return rand() % sides + 1;
    }

private:
    int sides;
};

int main() {
    // Create a Die object for each die type
    Die d20(20);
    Die d12(12);
    Die d10(10);
    Die d8(8);
    Die d6(6);
    Die d4(4);

    // Roll each die type 5 times and output the results
    cout << "D20 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d20.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "D12 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d12.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "D10 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d10.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "D8 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d8.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "D6 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d6.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "D4 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d4.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Multiple Inheritance

Simple Example of multiple inheritance for a warrior class. Thanks Ghat GPT, not sure what plagiarism is involved, but I still find errors in your code!

In this example, we have a base class Character that defines the basic properties and methods of a character, such as `attack()`, `defend()`, and `getHealth()`. We also have a `Warrior` class that inherits from `Character` and adds a `charge()` method, as well as a `Weapons` class that defines the basic properties and methods of a weapon, such as `attack()`. Finally, we have a `WarriorWithWeapon` class that inherits from both `Warrior` and `Weapons`, allowing it to use both the `charge()` method from Warrior and the `attack()` method from `Weapons`. It also adds a `specialAttack()` method that is unique to `WarriorWithWeapon`.

In the `main()` function, we create a `WarriorWithWeapon` object warrior with a name of "Conan", a health of 100, and a weapon of "Sword". We then call the `charge()`, `attack()`, `specialAttack()`, and `defend()` methods of warrior to demonstrate its abilities. We also update its health and output the new health value to show the use of the `setHealth()` and `getHealth()` methods from Character.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Character {
public:
    Character(string name, int health) {
        this->name = name;
        this->health = health;
    }

    void attack() {
        cout << name << " attacks!" << endl;
    }

    void defend() {
        cout << name << " defends!" << endl;
    }

    void setHealth(int health) {
        this->health = health;
    }

    int getHealth() {
        return health;
    }

protected:
    string name;
    int health;
};

class Warrior : public Character {
public:
    Warrior(string name, int health, string weapon) : Character(name, health) {
        this->weapon = weapon;
    }

    void charge() {
        cout << name << " charges into battle with " << weapon << "!" << endl;
    }

private:
    string weapon;
};

class Weapons {
public:
    Weapons(string weapon) {
        this->weapon = weapon;
    }

    void attack() {
        cout << "Attacking with " << weapon << "!" << endl;
    }

private:
    string weapon;
};

class WarriorWithWeapon : public Warrior, public Weapons {
public:
    WarriorWithWeapon(string name, int health, string weapon) : Warrior(name, health, weapon), Weapons(weapon) {}

    void specialAttack() {
        cout << name << " uses a special attack with " << weapon << "!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    WarriorWithWeapon warrior("Conan", 100, "Sword");

    warrior.charge();
    warrior.attack();
    warrior.specialAttack();
    warrior.defend();

    warrior.setHealth(warrior.getHealth() - 10);
    cout << warrior.getHealth() << " health remaining." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
