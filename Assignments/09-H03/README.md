## Homework 03 - Fix the Crappy Swap
#### Due: 11-05-2020 (Thursday @ 9:30 a.m.)


### Overview

Take the code in this folder and fix the swap method. Yes, we should use the built in vector swap, but we didn't. The issue is the indexes. Trace the code and fix ***i*** and ***j*** so that the resulting "hand" prints in ascending order from left to right.

- Create a banner with **H03** as part of the title (see [HERE](../../Resources/03-Banner/README.md))
- Don't print out all your code, just cut and paste your fixed sort method onto a sheet with your name and date. 
- Print out your banner and the sort method to hand in. Banner on top stapled to code below.
